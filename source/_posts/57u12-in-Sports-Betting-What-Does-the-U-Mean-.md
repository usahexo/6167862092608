# 57u12 in Sports Betting: What Does the U Mean? 

The u in 57u12 is short for "under" in sports betting. The number 57 stands for the point spread, while the u means that the underdog is expected to lose by fewer than 12 points. In this example, if the underdog loses by 11 points or less, then the bet would be a winner. If the underdog loses by more than 12 points, then the bet would be a loser.

# 57u12 in Sports Betting: Is There a Point Spread? 

The number 57u12 has come up frequently in sports betting, but what does it mean? Bettors seem to think that there is some sort of point spread associated with this number. But is there really anything to it?

If you take a look at the history of the wager, you'll see that 57u12 has only been hit a handful of times and never with any regularity. So what's the story behind this odd number?

Some believe that 57u12 is actually a code for another wager. Others think that it's simply a coincidence. But whatever the case may be, it's hard to say with any certainty what this number means for sports bettors.

# 57u12 in Sports Betting: How Does This Work?

57u12 is a three-digit number used in sports betting. What does it mean? How can you use it to your advantage when betting on sports?

 57u12 is the result of taking the last two digits of the year and multiplying them by 5.7, then adding 1.2. This number corresponds to a percentage chance that a team will win a game.

For example, in a game between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox, if 57u12 is listed as the line, it means that the bookies believe there is a 57% chance that the Yankees will win. If you think that the Yankees have a better chance of winning than that, you can bet on them at odds higher than 57-to-100 (or 2.18-to-1). If you think they're going to lose, you can bet on them at odds lower than 100-to-57 (or 1.79-to-1).

Similarly, in a game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Washington Redskins, if 57u12 is listed as the line, it means that the bookies believe there is a 57% chance that the Cowboys will win. 

This number can be useful for bettors because it gives them an idea of how likely each team is to win based on public opinion. If most people are betting on one team, but 57u12 says that the other team is more likely to win, then it might be wise to bet on the other team.
