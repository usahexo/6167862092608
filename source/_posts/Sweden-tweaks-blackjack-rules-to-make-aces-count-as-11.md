#  Sweden tweaks blackjack rules to make aces count as 11

The Swedish Gambling Authority (SGA) has announced a change to the blackjack rules that will make aces count as 11 points, instead of 1. The new rule will come into effect on January 1, 2019.

Sweden is not the first country to make this change; several other jurisdictions, including Macau and South Korea, have already adopted similar rules. The aim of the new rule is to make the game more exciting and attractive to players.

Under the old rules, blackjack was often seen as a relatively dull game, as players were more likely to win by taking small card values rather than hitting big hands. With aces counting as 1 point, it was often more advantageous for players to stand on stiff hands (hands totaling 12-16 points) than to risk busting (going over 21 points).

With the new rule in place, aces will now be much more valuable, increasing the chances of big payouts. This should make blackjack more exciting for players, and may lead to increased profits for casinos.

Some industry observers have raised concerns that the change could lead to an increase in cheating by casino staff. However, SGA has dismissed these fears, stating that its regulations include stringent anti-cheat measures.

#  Sweden's new blackjack rule a major win for players

In what's being seen as a major victory for blackjack players, the Swedish Gambling Authority has announced a new rule that will prohibit casinos from penalizing players for splitting pairs.

The new rule, which will come into effect on January 1st, 2019, means that players will be able to split any pairs of cards they are dealt, without fear of losing money. This is a significant change from the current rules, which allow casinos to penalize players for splitting pairs by reducing their bet size or even confiscating their winnings.

The rule change was announced earlier this month by the Swedish Gambling Authority and has been welcomed by blackjack enthusiasts and casino operators alike. Stefan Kögler, CEO of Svenska Spel, applauded the move, saying that it would "create a fairer game and increase transparency."

Players in Sweden have long been calling for changes to the way blackjack is played in the country, with many arguing that the current rules are unfair and give the casino an advantage. With the new rule change coming into effect in just a few months' time, Swedish blackjack players can look forward to a more level playing field when they hit the casino tables next year.

#  Sweden blackjack rules change: aces now count as 11

The Swedish Gambling Authority (SGA) has announced a change to the blackjack rules in Sweden. As of 1 January 2019, aces will now count as 11 points, instead of 1 point.

The reason for the rule change is to make blackjack more player-friendly and to increase the chances of them winning. The move is also expected to increase the appeal of blackjack in Sweden.

Under the new rules, if both the player and dealer have an ace, then the hand is still considered a tie (“push”). In addition, if the player has two aces, then their hand will be worth 22 points.

The SGA emphasised that the new rules only apply to live casino games and not those played online.

#  Sweden's new blackjack rule could shake up the game

In April 2017, the Swedish government voted in a new set of rules for blackjack that could have a significant impact on the game. The most important change is that players can now only double down on their first two cards, rather than on any two cards.

The Swedish government believes this rule change will make the game more fair and eliminate one of the casino's biggest advantages: the ability to use multiple strategies to increase their chances of winning. Under the new rules, doubling down will be more risky but also more rewarding, as players can now win a bigger payout for a successful hand.

Casino operators in Sweden are not happy with the new rules and have threatened to take legal action against the government. They argue that the rule change will negatively impact their business and cause many people to stop playing blackjack. However, the government has defended its decision, saying that it is necessary to create a more level playing field for all players.

The new blackjack rules will come into effect in January 2018. Until then, both casinos and players in Sweden are preparing for the big changes that are about to take place.

#  Sweden's move to make aces count as 11 in blackjack could help players

Following the example of several other countries, Sweden has decided to make aces count as 11 in blackjack instead of 1. The new rule came into effect on January 1st, and is expected to help players at the table.

Sweden is not the first country to make this change; several others have already done so, including Uruguay, Macau, and Peru. The idea behind the change is that it gives players a better chance of winning, as they can now standoff with a hand of 12 instead of having to hit and potentially lose.

It's not clear yet how much of an impact the new rule will have on blackjack in Sweden, but it's likely to be positive. In other countries where the rule has been introduced, it has led to an increase in the amount of money being wagered on blackjack games. This is good news for players, as it means that they have a better chance of making money from the game.

Whether or not you decide to take advantage of the new rule depends on your own playing style. If you're comfortable hitting when you have a hand of 12, then there's no reason to switch over to standing just because aces are counted as 11. However, if you're typically conservative when it comes to playing blackjack, then making the switch could help you win more often.
