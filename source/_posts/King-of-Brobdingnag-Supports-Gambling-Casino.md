#  King of Brobdingnag Supports Gambling Casino

Las Vegas, the gambling Mecca of the world may have found a new king in the form of King Brobdingnag. The ruler of the giants is putting his support behind the gambling industry in the city, and some are speculating that this could be a turning point for Las Vegas.

The king has reportedly sunk millions of dollars into casinos in Las Vegas, and he is not alone. Many other high-rollers from around the globe are now flocking to Sin City to take advantage of its newly lax gambling laws. In particular, Chinese and Russian high-rollers are now seen as a major force in casino revenues.

What does this mean for Las Vegas? It means that the city is no longer just about gaming, but about entertainment and luxury as well. Hotels like the Wynn and Venetian have been renovating their properties to include more luxury suites and amenities, and many new restaurants have sprung up to serve these new high-rolling customers.

The results have been impressive so far – casinos in Las Vegas are seeing record profits. While this may be bad news for those who like to gamble casually, it is great news for those who want to make a killing at the casino tables. If you’re looking to make some serious money, there’s no better place than Las Vegas right now!
