#  Where is spin casino licensed?

The answer to this question is not as straightforward as you may think. Different jurisdictions have different laws and regulations when it comes to online gambling, so it is not always clear which casinos are licensed in which jurisdiction.

In general, though, most reputable online casinos will be licensed in at least one major jurisdiction, such as the United Kingdom, Gibraltar, or Malta. Some casinos are even licensed in multiple jurisdictions, which gives players added peace of mind that the casino is operating legally and fairly.

If you are interested in playing at an online casino that is licensed in a specific jurisdiction, you can usually find this information on the casino’s website. Alternatively, you can check out a site like Casino Licensing for more information on the licensing process for different jurisdictions.

#  What are the wagering requirements at spin casino?

The wagering requirements at Spin Casino are 20x the deposit and bonus amount. This means that in order to withdraw any winnings from your account, you will need to wager at least 20 times the total value of your deposit and bonus combined.

Players can use any game at the casino to meet these requirements, but certain games contribute more towards the total than others. Slot games, for example, typically contribute 100% towards meeting the wagering requirements, while table games usually only contribute 10%.

This information is clearly displayed on the casino’s website, so it is easy for players to keep track of how much they need to wager before they can cash out their winnings.
