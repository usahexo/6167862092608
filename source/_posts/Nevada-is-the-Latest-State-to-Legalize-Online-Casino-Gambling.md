#  Nevada is the Latest State to Legalize Online Casino Gambling

Nevada has become the latest state to legalize online casino gambling. This move comes shortly after New Jersey made a similar decision and is part of a growing trend across the country.

Online casino gambling is now legal in nine states, including Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Maine. Each of these states has its own set of laws regulating the industry.

Some states allow only residents of that state to gamble on the websites of approved casinos. Others allow anyone over the age of 21 to gamble online. And still others have a mix of the two approaches.

The regulated online casino gambling industry is still in its infancy. It's unclear at this point how much revenue it will generate for states and casinos. But there is no doubt that it will be a big business in the years ahead.

Casinos are hopeful that online casino gambling will help them attract more customers and generate more revenue. And states are hopeful that it will provide another source of tax revenue.

Legalizing online casino gambling has been controversial in some states. Some people argue that it's a bad idea because it will lead to more gambling addiction problems. Others argue that it's a good idea because it will create jobs and bring in new revenue for states and casinos.

The jury is still out on whether or not online casino gambling is a good thing or a bad thing. But one thing is clear: It's here to stay. More and more states are likely to legalize it in the years ahead as they look for ways to increase revenue and attract new customers.

#  California Opens Its Doors to Online Casino Gambling

California’s Attorney General has announced that the state is now open for business when it comes to online casino gambling. This move means that companies in California can now apply for licenses to offer online casino games to players in the state.

This new development is good news for players in California, who will now have access to a wider range of online casino games. It is also good news for the industry, as it will create new jobs and tax revenue for the state.

It’s been a long time coming, but online casino gambling is finally coming to California. The news was announced on Wednesday by Attorney General Xavier Becerra.

The new law authorizes qualified operators to apply for licenses to offer online casino games to players in California. The AG’s office will be responsible for issuing licenses and regulating the industry.

This is great news for players in California, who will now have access to a wider selection of online casino games than ever before. The industry is also expected to benefit, asCaliforniais expected touse this new market as an opportunity torevenue and create jobs.

#  Delaware Authorizes First U.S. State-Licensed Online Casino

Delaware became the first U.S. state to license and regulate an online casino when it authorized 888 Holdings Plc to operate one in August 2013. The casino, named Delaware Park Online, offers blackjack, roulette, slots and video poker and is available to players in Delaware.

888 Holdings was among three operators who applied for a license after Delaware legalized online gambling in 2012. The others were Scientific Games International Corp and William Hill PLC. In awarding the license, Delaware regulators cited 888 Holdings' experience in running online casinos in other countries and its willingness to partner with the state's casino industry trade group, the Casino Association of Delaware.

The legalization of online gambling in Delaware was seen as a way to help the state's ailing casino industry, which has been hurt by competition from neighboring states with more gambling options.

#  New Jersey Becomes Third State to Legalize Online Casino Gambling

New Jersey has become the latest state to legalize online casino gambling, following in the footsteps of Nevada and Delaware. Under the new law, which took effect on January 24, 2013, registered players over 21 will be able to gamble in a range of casino games including blackjack, roulette and slots from their homes or mobile devices.

The passing of the bill was seen as a victory for Governor Chris Christie, who has been a vocal advocate for online gambling. Christie said that the new law would create jobs and generate much-needed revenue for the state’s ailing casinos and racetracks.

"I'm pleased that we are able to offer New Jersey's gaming consumers another legal and safe option when playing casino games," he said. "This is an industry that can create thousands of jobs throughout our state and generate important economic growth."

The move comes as no surprise given that New Jersey is one of only a few states where casino gambling is legal. What is surprising, however, is the strong opposition to online gambling from some quarters including religious groups and anti-gambling activists.

Critics argue that online gambling is addictive and can lead to financial ruin for those who participate. They also claim that it is easier to cheat at online casinos than traditional ones.

Governor Christie dismissed these criticisms, saying that they are unfounded. He pointed out that online casinos are subject to rigorous regulation and have systems in place to detect cheating.

"There's always going to be people who want to criticize something they don't understand," he said. "Online casino gaming is an entertainment option that offers tremendous economic benefits for our state."

On October 16, the Rhode Island governor signed a bill authorizing up to $15 million per year in online casino gambling. The legislation is designed to help the state make up for revenue lost as a result of Twin River Casino's move to Lincoln earlier this year.

The first phase of the new law, set to take effect on January 1, will allow players 18 and older to gamble on casino games including slots, blackjack, and roulette using their computers or mobile devices. The law allows the Rhode Island Lottery to partner with an operator to offer online casino gambling.

The second phase of the law, which is scheduled to go into effect on July 1, 2020, will allow casinos to offer online poker and other table games.

Rhode Island is the latest state to legalize online casino gambling. In May, New Jersey became the first state to launch online casino gambling when it launched regulated play at Atlantic City's Borgata Casino. Since then, Pennsylvania and Delaware have also legalized online casino gambling.
