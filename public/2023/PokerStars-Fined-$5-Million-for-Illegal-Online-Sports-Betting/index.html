            <h1 id="PokerStars-Fined-5-Million-for-Illegal-Online-Sports-Betting"><a href="#PokerStars-Fined-5-Million-for-Illegal-Online-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars Fined $5 Million for Illegal Online Sports Betting"></a>PokerStars Fined $5 Million for Illegal Online Sports Betting</h1><p>The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) announced a $5 million settlement with PokerStars for its role in illegal online sports betting.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, PokerStars will pay the state $3 million within 10 days and another $2 million within 18 months. It will also be banned from taking bets in New Jersey for two years.</p>
<p>“This resolution establishes a strong deterrent against illegal internet gambling and ensures that PokerStars will not be able to offer its unlicensed games to New Jersey residents,” said DGE Director David Rebuck.</p>
<p>PokerStars was among several companies targeted by the DGE as part of an investigation into illegal online sports betting. The company has already paid out more than $1 million to settle similar allegations in Kentucky and Pennsylvania.</p>
<h1 id="Iowa-Attorney-General-Says-PokerStars-Illegally-Offered-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Iowa-Attorney-General-Says-PokerStars-Illegally-Offered-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Iowa Attorney General Says PokerStars Illegally Offered Sports Betting"></a>Iowa Attorney General Says PokerStars Illegally Offered Sports Betting</h1><p>In a recent development, the Iowa Attorney General has concluded that PokerStars illegally offered sports betting to its customers. In a statement released by Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, it was noted that the company’s actions violated the state’s gambling laws.</p>
<p>The statement reads in part: “Our investigation found that PokerStars operated an illegal sports betting business in Iowa by accepting wagers on sporting events without first obtaining a license from the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission.”</p>
<p>The announcement is sure to be a major blow to PokerStars, which has been attempting to re-enter the U.S. market following its acquisition by Amaya Inc. The company had hoped to purchase the Atlantic Club Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, but the deal was scuttled earlier this year after regulators voiced concerns about PokerStars’ past illegal activities.</p>
<p>Iowa is one of several states where PokerStars is not currently authorized to offer gambling services. The company is currently licensed in only three states – New Jersey, Delaware, and Nevada.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Regulators-Issue-Cease-and-Desist-Order-to-PokerStars-Over-Alleged-Sports-Betting-Violations"><a href="#Nevada-Regulators-Issue-Cease-and-Desist-Order-to-PokerStars-Over-Alleged-Sports-Betting-Violations" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Regulators Issue Cease and Desist Order to PokerStars Over Alleged Sports Betting Violations"></a>Nevada Regulators Issue Cease and Desist Order to PokerStars Over Alleged Sports Betting Violations</h1><p>On Tuesday, the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) issued a cease and desist order to PokerStars over alleged violations of the state’s gaming regulations. The order alleges that the online poker giant engaged in unlicensed sports betting activities, which is a direct violation of Nevada law.</p>
<p>The NGCB also released an investigative report on PokerStars’ activities, which provides detailed evidence of the company’s alleged transgressions. The report claims that PokerStars operated several sports betting websites that accepted bets from Nevada residents, without first obtaining a license from the state.</p>
<p>In a statement released to the media, A.G. Burnett, chairman of the NGCB, said that “PokerStars has willfully and repeatedly violated our state’s gaming regulations, and must now face the consequences.” He added that “the Board will not tolerate such flagrant violations of our gaming laws, and will take whatever action is necessary to protect the interests of our citizens.”</p>
<p>Officials with PokerStars have denied any wrongdoing, and say they are in compliance with all applicable laws. In a statement issued to the media, Eric Hollreiser, head of corporate communications for PokerStars parent company Amaya Inc., said “We are disappointed that the NVGC has chosen to take this aggressive and meritless action against us. We have always aimed to operate our business fairly within all legal and regulatory frameworks in jurisdictions where we do business.”</p>
<p>The cease and desist order means that PokerStars is effectively barred from doing business in Nevada. The company has been given until February 6th to shut down all its operations in the state. If it fails to comply with the order, it could face stiff penalties including fines and possible criminal charges.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that PokerStars has run into trouble with US regulators. The company was forced to shut down its operations in New Jersey last year after it was accused of violating state gambling laws. It also paid a $731 million settlement to US authorities as part of a crackdown on illegal online gambling.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Online-Gambling-Bust-Nets-PokerStars"><a href="#New-Jersey-Online-Gambling-Bust-Nets-PokerStars" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Online Gambling Bust Nets PokerStars"></a>New Jersey Online Gambling Bust Nets PokerStars</h1><p>On Thursday, December 10, law enforcement officials in New Jersey announced the arrest of 11 individuals on charges related to online gambling. The defendants, all of whom are from New Jersey, are alleged to have operated a website called “PokerStars” that facilitated illegal online gambling. According to authorities, the website generated over $3 million in profits over a two-year period.</p>
<p>Eleven individuals were indicted as a result of the investigation, including the site’s alleged owner and operator, 41-year-old James Bitonti. The other defendants are all believed to have played a role in running the site, including marketing it and processing payments.</p>
<p>According to New Jersey authorities, PokerStars is not licensed or registered to operate in the state. In addition to violating state law, the site is also alleged to have violated federal gambling laws.</p>
<p>Online gambling is illegal in most U.S. states, but has been growing increasingly popular in recent years. In addition to PokerStars, several other well-known online poker sites are also based outside of the United States.</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-Shut-Down-in-the-US-After-Being-Linked-to-Illegal-Online-Sports-Betting"><a href="#PokerStars-Shut-Down-in-the-US-After-Being-Linked-to-Illegal-Online-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars Shut Down in the US After Being Linked to Illegal Online Sports Betting"></a>PokerStars Shut Down in the US After Being Linked to Illegal Online Sports Betting</h1><p>In a major development for the online gaming industry, PokerStars has been shut down in the United States after being linked to illegal online sports betting. The closure of PokerStars comes just months after its parent company, The Stars Group, agreed to pay a record $700 million penalty to the US government to settle charges that it had violated gambling laws.</p>
<p>“PokerStars was both reckless and wilfully blind to the fact that it was aiding and abetting unlawful Conduct by providing its services to illegal offshore sportsbooks,” said Deputy Attorney General Brian Benczkowski in a statement.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that PokerStars has been shut down in the United States. In 2011, the company was forced to shut down its operations in the country after being indicted on charges of money laundering and bank fraud. However, PokerStars eventually reached a settlement with US authorities and resumed operations in the country in 2013.</p>
<p>The closure of PokerStars is likely to be a major blow to the online gaming industry, which has been grappling with increasing regulatory pressure in recent years. In addition to the closure of PokerStars, several other major players in the online gaming industry have faced legal challenges in recent months, including CrownBet, William Hill Australia, and 988 Holdings.</p>
