PG can lead to significant problems in various life domains, including occupational, financial, and social functioning, as well as physical and psychological health. The diagnosis of PG is based on clinical judgement; there are currently no DSM-5 criteria for PG. In this article we will present a scoring system for assessing problem gambling behavior.</p>
<p>Problem gambling behavior can be assessed with the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI), a 9-item self-report instrument that assesses the severity of gambling problems. The PGSI assigns a score from 0 to 3 for each item, for a total possible score of 27. Scores of 3 or more indicate that the individual has a problem with gambling. The PGSI has been shown to have good reliability and validity.</p>
<p>Another measure of problem gambling is the Canadian Problem Gambling Index (CPGI). The CPGI is a 17-item self-report instrument that assesses problem gambling behavior and symptoms of addiction. The CPGI also assigns a score from 0 to 3 for each item, for a total possible score of 51. Scores of 10 or more indicate that the individual has a problem with gambling. The CPGI has been shown to have good reliability and validity.</p>
<p>There are also several other measures of problem gambling that have been developed over the years. A summary of these measures can be found in Table 1 below.</p>
<p>Table 1: Summary of Measures of Problem Gambling</p>
<p>Measure Name Number of Items Associated Score Range Canadian Problem Gambling Index (CPGI) 17 0 – 51 Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) 9 0 – 27 South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) 20 0 – 20 Game Addiction Scale (GAS) 15 0 – 45 Illinois Gambling Screen (IGS) 9 0 – 36 Wisconsin Inventory of Gamblers’ Problems (WIGP) 14 0 – 35 Manchester GambleScreen (MGS) 11 0 – 33 Behavioral Inhibition System&#x2F;Behavioral Activation System scales 4 &#x2F; 7 -2 &#x2F; 2 -10 &#x2F; 10 Gordon’s Functional Impairment Scale for Pathological Gambling 4 0 – 12 UCLA Questionnaire on Gambling Behavior 4 0 – 16 Brisbane Alcohol and Other Drugs Scale: Gambling Module 10 n&#x2F;a California Psychological Inventory—Addiction Scale 8 -4 to 4 DSM-IV Diagnostic Criteria for Pathological Gambling 6 n&#x2F;a</p>
<p>The most commonly used measure of problem gambling is the PGSI; however, the CPGI may be a better measure for individuals who report more severe symptoms of addiction. When selecting a measure of problem gambling, it is important to consider the population being studied and the purpose of the assessment.</p>
<h1 id="Pathological-gambling-measure-how-to-score-problem"><a href="#Pathological-gambling-measure-how-to-score-problem" class="headerlink" title="Pathological gambling measure: how to score problem"></a>Pathological gambling measure: how to score problem</h1><p>Pathological gambling is a mental health disorder characterized by excessive or uncontrollable gambling. Pathological gambling has been included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) since 1980.</p>
<p>The American Psychiatric Association (APA) defines pathological gambling as follows:</p>
<p>Pathological gambling is a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior that causes significant personal, social, or occupational impairment. The pattern of gambling behavior is indicated by seven or more of the following criteria in a 12-month period: 1) g impulsiveness or taking risks; 2) preoccupation with gambling; 3) need to gamble with increasing amounts of money to achieve the desired excitement; 4) unsuccessful attempts to cut back or stop gambling; 5) Lies to cover up the extent of involvement with gambling; 6) stealing or borrowing money to gamble; 7) feeling restless or irritable when unable to gamble; 8) chasing losses by returning to gamble sooner than intended; 9) losingControl over time spent on gambling activities; 10) sacrificing important social, occupational, or recreational activities because of gambling; 11) continuing to gamble despite knowing there are negative consequences.</p>
<p>People with pathological gambling often exhibit signs and symptoms similar to other addictions, such as alcohol and drug abuse. These individuals often have a history of problems in their personal lives and&#x2F;or with money. They may also have a history of criminal activity.</p>
<p>Pathological gamblers generally suffer from low self-esteem and depression. They may also exhibit suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Pathological gamblers often deny that they have a problem and may be in complete denial about the serious negative consequences of their addiction.</p>
<p>The Pathological Gambling Severity Index (PGSI), developed in 2004, is a nine-item measure used to assess the severity of pathological gambling. The PGSI measures the extent and severity of symptoms associated with pathological gambling. The PGSI can be used to help determine if someone has a pathological gambling problem and whether that person needs treatment for their problem.</p>
<p>The nine items on the PGSI are as follows: 1) Have you ever gambled longer than you had planned? 2) Have you ever tried unsuccessfully to stop or reduce your gambling? 3) Do you spend more time thinking about gambling than you wanted to? 4) Do you feel restless or irritable when trying not to gamble? 5) Do you sometimes gamble again after losing money?) 6} Do you sometimes borrow money, sell possessions, or skip payments in order to finance your gambling? 7} Have you ever felt guilty after gambling? 8} Did anyone close to you complain about how much time you were spending on your hobby? 9} Did your job or studies suffer because of your hobby? </p>
<p>  To score the PGSI, each item is rated on a scale from 0 (not at all )to 4 (a great deal ). The total scores range from 0to 36, with higher scores indicating greater severity of pathology . </p>
<p>  A score of 3 or higher on five or more items indicates that the individual has a pathological gambling problem . </p>
