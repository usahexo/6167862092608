            <h1 id="Trump-Casino-Fined-for-Laundering-Money-in-Poker-Game"><a href="#Trump-Casino-Fined-for-Laundering-Money-in-Poker-Game" class="headerlink" title="Trump Casino Fined for Laundering Money in Poker Game"></a>Trump Casino Fined for Laundering Money in Poker Game</h1><p>The Trump Taj Mahal casino was fined on Wednesday for a nearly $10 million violation of anti-money laundering regulations, the Wall Street Journal reports.</p>
<p>According to the Journal, the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network found that the Taj Mahal had failed to file “suspicious activity reports” regarding several large poker games that had taken place at the casino between 2010 and 2014.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department said in a statement that the casino had been “grossly negligent” in its money laundering prevention efforts.</p>
<p>Owned by President Donald Trump until he sold it in 1990, the Taj Mahal was fined $8 million in 2015 for similar violations. At the time, then-owner Carl Icahn blamed the violations on previous management.</p>
<p>In a statement given to Reuters, a spokesman for Icahn Enterprises blamed Wednesday’s fine on the current ownership and said that they were working to fix the problems.</p>
<p>“We are confident that we have now corrected these issues and are committed to full compliance with all anti-money laundering laws and regulations,” he said.</p>
<h1 id="Trump-Casino-fined-for-facilitating-illegal-cash-transactions"><a href="#Trump-Casino-fined-for-facilitating-illegal-cash-transactions" class="headerlink" title="Trump Casino fined for facilitating illegal cash transactions"></a>Trump Casino fined for facilitating illegal cash transactions</h1><p>According to a Reuters report, the Trump Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey has been fined $10 million for “repeatedly violating a federal anti-money laundering law.” The casino has been accused of “failing to properly report cash transactions” between 2009 and 2014.</p>
<p>The fine is the largest ever levied by the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). In a statement, FinCEN director Jennifer Shasky Calvery said that the Trump Taj Mahal had “knowingly and willfully violated” the Bank Secrecy Act.</p>
<p>In a press release, the Trump Organization said that it was in the process of selling the casino to Carl Icahn, and that it “cannot comment on matters that are subject to legal proceedings.” The organization added that it was “committed to strict compliance with all government regulations and is currently in full compliance with all laws and regulations.”</p>
<p>The Trump Taj Mahal is not the only Trump-owned casino to have run into trouble with financial regulators. In January, Forbes reported that the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino had failed to pay its debts for several months, and that Eric Trump had been forced to step in and help finance its operations.</p>

<p>The casino admitted that between 2010 and 2013, it failed to report suspicious transactions and properly file required currency transaction reports.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, the casino also agreed to improve its money laundering compliance program.</p>
<p>“This casino engaged in serious violations of key provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act,” said Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Director Jennifer Shasky Calvery. “Today’s action should send a message to all casinos that they must comply with these important safeguards aggressively and effectively.”</p>
<h1 id="Trump-Entertainment-Resorts-fined-for-cash-laundering-in-poker-game"><a href="#Trump-Entertainment-Resorts-fined-for-cash-laundering-in-poker-game" class="headerlink" title="Trump Entertainment Resorts fined for cash laundering in poker game"></a>Trump Entertainment Resorts fined for cash laundering in poker game</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>On Tuesday, Trump Entertainment Resorts was fined by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement for their role in a money laundering scheme during a poker game.</p>
<p>The gaming enforcement division fined the casino operator $10,000 after an investigation revealed that the company had facilitated money laundering activity between two gamblers back in 2014. The two gamblers were fined a total of $27,500.</p>
<p>According to the findings of the investigation, Trump Entertainment Resorts allowed one gambler to exchange $2,000 for chips and then use those chips to pay off the other gambler’s debt. In doing so, the company bypassed state regulations that prohibit such transactions.</p>
<p>“This case demonstrates our commitment to aggressively pursue those who break New Jersey’s gambling laws,” said David Rebuck, director of the state’s gaming enforcement division. “It is critically important that we protect our casinos from criminal activity.”</p>
<p>Trump Entertainment Resorts released a statement saying that they were fully cooperating with the investigation and regretted any inconvenience that it may have caused.</p>
<h1 id="Trump-casino-fined-10-million-for-illegal-cash-transactions"><a href="#Trump-casino-fined-10-million-for-illegal-cash-transactions" class="headerlink" title="Trump casino fined $10 million for illegal cash transactions"></a>Trump casino fined $10 million for illegal cash transactions</h1><p>The Trump Taj Mahal casino was fined $10 million for violating anti-money laundering regulations, the Treasury Department announced Thursday.</p>
<p>The penalty is the latest in a series of woes for the casino and its owner, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The casino, which is now closed, had engaged in “significant and long-standing money laundering violations,” including repeated failures to report customers’ bank transactions over $10,000, according to the Treasury Department.</p>
<p>“This action underscores our commitment to protect the U.S. financial system from illicit use and to ensure that casinos are not used to launder money,” Acting Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Adam Szubin said in a statement.</p>
<p>The fine comes as Trump has been battling accusations that he has ties to Russia because of his business ventures there. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
