The college has had a few different owners throughout the years. Here is a brief overview of who has owned Dickinson College over the years.</p>
<p>The college was first founded by Benjamin Rush in 18 Dickinson. Rush was a signer of the Declaration of Independence and a physician. He donated $200,000 to the cause of establishing the college. However, it wasn’t until five years after his death that the college opened its doors to students.</p>
<p>The college then passed through a few different owners including an association of local merchants and William Henry Waddell, who was a Presbyterian Minister. In 1883, the college came into the hands of HenryHE Foote who was an Episcopal Minister. It was during Foote’s time as owner that the college began to see some major changes.</p>
<p>Foote made it his mission to make Dickinson one of the country’s leading schools and instituted many new reforms including adding more course offerings and making the school co-educational. In 1903, Dickinson became a women’s college with the admission of its first class of female students.</p>
<p>The next owner of Dickinson College was Robert J Walker who bought the school in 1930 for $1 million. Walker was a businessman and politician who served as Secretary of Commerce under President Herbert Hoover. Walker made several improvements to the campus during his time as owner including expanding athletic facilities and building a new library.</p>
<p>Walker also played a role in getting Dickinson accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in 1941. This accreditation is still valid today which means that Dickinson is one of just three colleges in Pennsylvania that hold this distinction.</p>
<p>In 1960, Dickinson College came into the hands of Lawrence Hutton who was an entrepreneur and philanthropist from Philadelphia. Hutton made several donations to the college including funding for scholarships, professorships, and research initiatives. In addition, he helped to renovate many campus buildings including Anderson Hall, Old West dormitory, and Herter Hall Art Gallery.</p>
<p>Hutton also helped to establish several new programs at Dickinson including environmental studies, Africana studies, business administration, and pre-medical studies which are still offered today. After Hutton’s death in 2000, his wife Betsy took over ownership of the school until 2003 when she donated it to The Richard S Baldwin Foundation Incorporated which is a non-profit organization she created specifically for this purpose.</p>
