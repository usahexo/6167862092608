            <h1 id="Nevada-Sports-Betting-Apps-are-Legal"><a href="#Nevada-Sports-Betting-Apps-are-Legal" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Sports Betting Apps are Legal"></a>Nevada Sports Betting Apps are Legal</h1><p>Nevada sports betting apps are now legal for those physically located within the state. The Nevada Gaming Commission passed the regulation on Thursday, September 28, legalizing mobile apps for sports betting at any of the state’s casinos.</p>
<p>“We’re living in a new world and with this new world comes new technology,” said commission chairman Tony Alamo. “This is an important step for the Gaming Commission and for the gaming industry.”</p>
<p>The regulation allows both casino-based and retail sportsbooks to offer their products through approved mobile apps. Players must be physically located in Nevada in order to place a bet, and must be at least 21 years old. Casinos will be allowed to partner with approved third-party app developers, but will not be allowed to develop their own apps.</p>
<p>The move comes as no surprise, as Nevada has been a pioneer in the development of legal sports betting. The state was the first to allow sports betting in 1949, and currently boasts more than 100 legal sportsbooks. In 2013, Nevada voters approved the legalization of mobile sports betting, but Thursday’s regulation was the first time that specific guidelines have been put in place for how it should be offered.</p>
<p>“This gives us an opportunity to get out in front of our competition,” said Jay Kornegay, vice president of race and sports operations at Las Vegas’s Westgate SuperBook. “They may have brick-and-mortar books in other states, but we’re going to have the best product because we’ll have the latest and greatest technology.”</p>
<p>Kornegay believes that mobile betting will account for around 60% of Westgate’s total sports betting handle in the near future. Other casinos are expecting similar increases. MGM Resorts International spokeswoman Debra Hart says that her company plans to offer mobile betting through its existing app and expects it to comprise about half of its overall bets within two years.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Released-Sports-Betting-App-Regulations"><a href="#Nevada-Released-Sports-Betting-App-Regulations" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Released Sports Betting App Regulations"></a>Nevada Released Sports Betting App Regulations</h1><p>On Wednesday,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> the Nevada Gaming Control Board released regulations for sports betting operators who want to offer their services through a mobile app.</p>
<p>The regulations cover a number of topics, including how the apps must function, the security measures that operators must put in place, and the information that must be displayed on the app’s user interface.</p>
<p>In order to prevent cheating and manipulation of the betting system, operators must use a random number generator to determine the outcome of games. The Random Number Generator must be certified by an independent testing lab.</p>
<p>Operators must also ensure that customers are at least 21 years old and that they are located within Nevada’s borders when they place bets.</p>
<p>The regulations also stipulate that operators must pay a 20% tax on all gross gaming revenue generated by sports betting through their app. In addition, they must contribute 5% of their gross gaming revenue to the State Gaming Fund.</p>
<p>Nevada is one of only a few states that has legalized sports betting in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling in May that struck down the federal ban on sports gambling. In response to that ruling, Delaware and New Jersey have both begun allowing sports betting at casinos and racetracks in those states.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada’s-First-Sports-Betting-App-Goes-Live"><a href="#Nevada’s-First-Sports-Betting-App-Goes-Live" class="headerlink" title="Nevada’s First Sports Betting App Goes Live"></a>Nevada’s First Sports Betting App Goes Live</h1><p>The state of Nevada has always been at the forefront of gambling and gaming. This is especially true when it comes to sports betting. So it should come as no surprise that Nevada’s first legal sports betting app has gone live.</p>
<p>The app, called simply “Nevada Sports,” is available now in the App Store and Google Play. It’s free to download, and you can start placing bets right away.</p>
<p>The app offers all the features you’d expect from a top-notch sports betting app. You can bet on all the major sporting events, both in the United States and around the world. You can also bet on college sports and other not-so-major events.</p>
<p>Best of all, Nevada Sports is fully licensed and regulated by the Nevada Gaming Commission. So you can rest assured that your money is safe and your bets are fair.</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of sports betting, then Nevada Sports is definitely worth checking out.</p>
<h1 id="More-Nevada-Gambling-Companies-Launch-Sports-Betting-Apps"><a href="#More-Nevada-Gambling-Companies-Launch-Sports-Betting-Apps" class="headerlink" title="More Nevada Gambling Companies Launch Sports Betting Apps"></a>More Nevada Gambling Companies Launch Sports Betting Apps</h1><p>Following the lead of MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment, two more of Nevada’s biggest gambling companies have launched sports betting apps. Station Casinos and South Point announced their new apps on Thursday, both offering in-game wagering and other features.</p>
<p>The move comes as no surprise, as the state’s gaming regulators granted approval for such apps earlier this week. It also follows a Supreme Court decision in May that allowed states to legalize sports betting.</p>
<p>Since then, a handful of states have taken action, including New Jersey, which launched its own sports betting app on Thursday. Arkansas also began taking sports bets last week, while Mississippi is preparing to do so.</p>
<p>Nevada has been at the forefront of legal gambling in the U.S. for decades, with casinos dotting the Las Vegas Strip and other parts of the state. The new sports betting apps are just the latest development in an industry that is constantly evolving.</p>
<p>For Station Casinos, which owns 17 properties across Nevada, the launch of its new app is part of a larger strategy to grow its mobile gaming business. “As we continue to expand our mobile offerings we are committed to providing our guests with a best-in-class experience,” said President and CEO Frank Fertitta III in a statement.</p>
<h1 id="US-Supreme-Court-to-Hear-New-Jersey-Sports-Betting-Appeal"><a href="#US-Supreme-Court-to-Hear-New-Jersey-Sports-Betting-Appeal" class="headerlink" title="US Supreme Court to Hear New Jersey Sports Betting Appeal"></a>US Supreme Court to Hear New Jersey Sports Betting Appeal</h1><p>The United States Supreme Court has announced that it will hear New Jersey’s appeal of a lower court ruling that upheld a federal ban on sports betting across the country. The high court agreed to hear the case in October, but did not announce a decision on whether to take the case until Monday.</p>
<p>The state of New Jersey has been trying to legalize sports betting since 2011, but has been blocked by the federal government. In 2014, New Jersey passed a law allowing sports betting at casinos and racetracks, but was sued by the NCAA, NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLB.</p>
<p>In 2016, a federal judge ruled in favor of the sports leagues, saying that New Jersey’s law violated the 1992 federal law called the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). The Third Circuit Court of Appeals later affirmed that ruling.</p>
<p>New Jersey is asking the Supreme Court to overturn that ruling and allow the state to legalize sports betting. The Supreme Court is expected to hear oral arguments in the case in February and issue a ruling by June.</p>
<p>If the Supreme Court decides to overturn the lower court rulings, it would open up the possibility for other states to legalize sports betting. It could also lead to challenges to PASPA itself.</p>
<p>Some legal experts believe that PASPA is unconstitutional because it violates states’ rights under the 10th Amendment. Others believe that PASPA is unconstitutional because it discriminates against certain states (like New Jersey) that want to legalize sports betting.</p>
