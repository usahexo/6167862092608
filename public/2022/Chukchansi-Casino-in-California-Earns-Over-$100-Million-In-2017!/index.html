According to a report from the gaming venue, they earned over $100 million in revenue last year. This is the first time that their revenues have topped the $100 million mark.</p>
<p>In addition to the record setting revenue, the casino also reported that they set a new attendance record in 2017. More than 2.7 million guests visited the casino last year, which is an increase of more than 8% from 2016.</p>
<p>“Our team’s hard work and dedication to our guests continues to pay off with another record-breaking year at Chukchansi Gold Resort &amp; Casino,” said Executive Vice President and General Manager Geir Imsland in a statement released by the casino. “We are excited to see continued growth across all areas of our business and look forward to providing our guests with industry-leading gaming and entertainment experiences in 2018 and beyond.”</p>
<p>The Chukchansi Gold Resort and Casino originally opened in 2004 as a tribal casino run by the Picayune Rancheria of Chukchansi Indians tribe. In 2015, the casino was shut down due to disputes between the tribe and its members. The closure resulted in the loss of more than 1,000 jobs.</p>
<p>The casino reopened in 2016 after being seized by federal authorities and placed into receivership. The tribe agreed to new terms for running the casino, including stricter financial controls and allowing third-party audits.</p>
