The clay composite will start to decompose over time and the casino chip will eventually fall apart. How long this takes depends on how much exposure to air and light the chip has. If it is stored in a dark place, it could last for many years. However, if it is stored in an area where there is a lot of air circulation, it could only last for a few months.</p>
<h1 id="How-long-could-you-store-casino-chips-before-they-expired"><a href="#How-long-could-you-store-casino-chips-before-they-expired" class="headerlink" title="How long could you store casino chips before they expired?"></a>How long could you store casino chips before they expired?</h1><p>The life of a casino chip can be quite short. Depending on the type of chip and how it is stored, they could last anywhere from a few weeks to a few years. In some cases, casino chips may only be valid for a single use.</p>
<p>Many factors go into how long casino chips will last. The type of material used to make the chip is one important consideration. Some materials, like ceramics and plastics, are more durable than others and will last longer. The printing on the chip can also degrade over time, making the chip less visually appealing.</p>
<p>The environment where the chips are stored is also important. Chips that are exposed to sunlight or high levels of humidity will deteriorate faster than those that are kept in a dark and dry place. Temperature can also play a role in how long casino chips lasts; cooler temperatures slow down the aging process while warmer temperatures speed it up.</p>
<p>There is no definitive answer as to how long casino chips can last because there are so many variables involved. However, most chips have a lifespan of somewhere between 12 and 24 months.</p>
<h1 id="How-long-do-casino-chips-last-before-they-rot"><a href="#How-long-do-casino-chips-last-before-they-rot" class="headerlink" title="How long do casino chips last before they rot?"></a>How long do casino chips last before they rot?</h1><p>Casino chips are made from a composite material that is designed to last. However, over time, the casino chip can degrade and eventually rot. The rate at which a casino chip degrades depends on a number of factors, including the climate, type of storage and handling conditions.</p>
<p>In general, casino chips last anywhere from two to five years before they start to degrade. The main component that breaks down in the composite material is the starch-based adhesive that is used to bind the different materials together. As this adhesive breaks down, it can cause the chip to become brittle and crack.</p>
<p>If a casino chip is stored in a humid environment, it will degrade faster than if it is stored in a dry environment. The same is true for how the chip is handled. Chips that are handled regularly will wear down more quickly than those that are not handled as often.</p>
<p>The good news is that most casinos regularly test their chips to make sure they are still in good condition. If a chip does start to degrade, the casino will usually replace it with a new one. So, unless you are storing your casino chips in an exceptionally humid or dry environment, they should last for at least a couple of years before any degradation occurs.</p>

The oils from your hands can discolor and damage the chips over time. If you must handle them, be sure to use a light touch and keep them in a cool, dry place.</p>
<h1 id="How-long-can-you-store-casino-chips-before-they-expire"><a href="#How-long-can-you-store-casino-chips-before-they-expire" class="headerlink" title="How long can you store casino chips before they expire?"></a>How long can you store casino chips before they expire?</h1><p>Casino chips can last indefinitely as long as they are not used. Once they are put into play, however, the life of a chip is typically only 5-7 minutes. This is due to their composition – clay and other materials used in their production that can start to wear down with use.</p>
